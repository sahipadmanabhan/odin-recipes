        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Arancini are delicious, crispy, deep fried Sicilian balls of rice. They have a meat sauce and mozzarella cheese filling and crunchy breadcrumb coating. Similar Italian rice balls are called supplì in Rome and the nearby region.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3><em>Filling</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat sauce or tomato sauce</li>
            <li>4 oz mozzarella cut into 1/2" or 3/4" cubes</li>
            <li>3 oz cooked peas (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Risotto</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 oz white wine</li>
            <li>Approximately 30 oz of chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 cups Carnaroli or Arborio rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Breading</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
            <li>More tomato sauce, to serve</li>
            <li>Basil leaves, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the risotto by adding the rice to the heated oil in a large saute pan, and stirring quickly for one or two minutes. Quickly add the white wine while stirring. With the heat on medium high, begin adding the chicken stock a little at a time, and continuously stirring, until all the stock has been used and the rice is cooked, yet still al dente (I have a risotto recipe here on my blog). Taste; adding salt if necessary. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Add an egg to the risotto and mix well, then refrigerate for a few hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>To make the arancini: Place some rice in your hand and flatten it into your cupped hand, but don’t make it too thin, or the filling will ooze out. Place a piece of mozzarella, and/or a little tomato sauce (and peas, if using) in the center of the cupped rice. Next, close the rice around the filling and shape into a ball.</li>
            <li>If you’d like to make conical shapes, flatten the bottom of the ball, and make the top more pointed.</li>
            <li>Now, roll the shaped arancini in flour, then roll them in the beaten egg, and finally the breadcrumbs. Set aside until all of the rice has been used.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a deep fryer, pot or wok until it is very hot. Add the arancini, and cook quickly, turning often so they don’t brown too much on one side. If serving immediately, fry for a few minutes, so the cheese will melt in the center. Remove from oil and place on paper towel lined plate or tray. (If you’d like to serve them at a later time, remove them quickly after just browning; then, just before serving, place them on a baking sheet and re-heat in the oven at 400ºF for 5 to 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Serve plain, or place on tray with a little tomato sauce and garnish with basil. You can also serve them with a little extra sauce on the side, although this isn't done in Italy.</li>
